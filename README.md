## 🤖 API Testing with Robot Framework
Hey there! 👋 This repo is all about testing APIs the easy and fun way using Robot Framework. We’re using the public GoREST API to test basic user-related endpoints. 

## 🔍 What Are We Testing?
We’re playing around with GoREST’s user endpoints. Specifically:

1. Create User → POST /users
2. List Users → GET /users
3. Update User → PUT /users/:id

## 🧰 What Tools Are We Using?
1. Robot Framework – Our main testing buddy
2. GoREST API – Real API for real testing
3. Jenkins – Because automation is life 🤖
